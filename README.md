It's been a year since the national quarantine threw us into months of lockdown with fallacious time frames continually announced. Now that society begins to open its sanitized doors, let's be honest does any really remember what you did 10 months, 6 months or even a week ago? Does anyone recall what they used to do for fun without the constraints of a mask? Does anyone really remember where their favorite breweries are? Don't panic, we have the answer to your predicament. Our application Deja Brew will help you remember and locate some of your nearby breweries. By logging in and confirming your age you can browse through breweries generated by users, create a new brewery in your area and also post a review about their personal hygiene! We understand the daze, lockdown has put us all through and we are here to help.
